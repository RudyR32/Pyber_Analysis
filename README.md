## Summary Data Frame Analysis
![Summary Dataframe](https://github.com/RudyR32/Pyber_Analysis/blob/master/analysis/Fig9.png)
As population density decrease the number of rides decrease 1625 in urban citys to 125 in rural citys.  Similarly and number of drivers also decreases from 2405 in urban areas to 78 in rural citys.  Conversely, the average Fare per Ride and the average Fare per Driver both increase as the population density decreases.  These seem to be correlated because in an ecosystem where the ratio of rides to drives is higher you would expect rides to be more expensive than an ecosystem where there are actually more drivers than rides to be given.
Note:  In every case suburban cities slotted in between urban and rural as would be expect.
