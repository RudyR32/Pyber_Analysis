# Pyber_Analysis
## Background
Youâ€™ve been asked by your CEO to create an overall snapshot of the ride-sharing data. In addition to your scatter and pie charts, she would like to see a summary table of key metrics of the ride-sharing data by city type, and a multiple-line graph that shows the average fare for each week by each city type. <br />
## Summary Data Frame Analysis
![Summary Dataframe](https://github.com/RudyR32/Pyber_Analysis/blob/master/analysis/Fig9.png) <br />
As population density decrease the number of rides decrease 1625 in urban citys to 125 in rural citys.  Similarly and number of drivers also decreases from 2405 in urban cities to 78 in rural cities.  Conversely, the average Fare per Ride and the average Fare per Driver both increase as the population density decreases.  These seem to be correlated because in an ecosystem where the ratio of rides to drives is higher you would expect rides to be more expensive than an ecosystem where there are actually more drivers than rides to be given.   <br />
Note:  In every case suburban cities slotted in between urban and rural as would be expect.
## Multiple Line Graph Analysis
![Multiple Line Graph of Weekly Fares](https://github.com/RudyR32/Pyber_Analysis/blob/master/analysis/Fig8.png) <br />
This figure gives a visual representation of the total weekly fares between January and April in the 3 city types(Rural, Suburban and Urban).  Urban cities are by far the largest total fare producers with there total weekly fares peaking around $2500 verses ~$1400 in suburban cities and ~$500 in rural cities.  For compariosn sake this equates being urban weekly fares being about 2x those of suburban cities and between 5x and 10x that of rural cities depending on the week.
